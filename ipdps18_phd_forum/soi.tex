\subsection{Short bio sketch}
I am currently a third year PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering (ECE) department at Rutgers University and a member of the RADICAL

in ECE working with the RADICAL group at Rutgers University and a Bachelor's in 
Electronics and Communication Engineering from SSN College of Engineering, Anna
University, Chennai, India.


\subsection{Current research interests}
I was introduced to the concept of abstractions and ensemble-based applications 
in molecular dynamics during my research, towards my Master's, with the RADICAL 
group.
