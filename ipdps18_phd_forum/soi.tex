\subsection{Short bio sketch}
I am currently a third year PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering (ECE) department at Rutgers University and a member of the RADICAL
group, lead by Dr. Shantenu Jha. Prior to my PhD program, I obtained my Master's
in ECE working with the RADICAL group at Rutgers University and a Bachelor's in 
Electronics and Communication Engineering from SSN College of Engineering, Anna
University, Chennai, India.

\subsection{Current research interests}
I was introduced to the concept of abstractions and ensemble-based applications
(EBAs) in molecular dynamics during my research, towards my Master's, with the 
RADICAL group. My research consisted of a survey of existing frameworks that 
provide abstractions for resource management and task execution of EBAs. This
work culminated in the development of Ensemble Toolkit~\cite{entk} (EnTK v0.1) 
and ExTASY~\cite{extasy}. My current research in abstractions for execution of 
EBAs on HPCs lead to the identification of three separate layers of concern: (1) 
specification of tasks and resource requirements, (2) task-graph traversal and 
(3) resource selection and acquisition, and task execution management. I am 
interested in the concepts of component-based software engineering and studying
their potential in enabling composability and reuse in frameworks in the HPC 
community~\cite{review_bb_2016}.
